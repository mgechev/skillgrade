# Skill Eval

Evaluation framework for [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home). Inspired by [SkillsBench](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.12670v1) and [Demystifying Evals for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents).

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 24+, npm, Docker

```bash
npm install
```

Run your first eval (requires a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)):

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key npm run eval -- superlint
```

Verify infrastructure without an API key:

```bash
npm run test:bootstrap
```

## Core Concepts

- **Tasks** — Self-contained directories in `tasks/` with an instruction, Dockerfile, and graders.
- **Skills** — Co-located in `tasks/<name>/skills/`, auto-injected into `.agents/skills/` (Gemini) and `.claude/skills/` (Claude) for native discovery. See [Skills Best Practices](http://github.com/mgechev/skills-best-practices) for authoring guidelines.
- **Graders** — Multiple graders per task: deterministic (shell scripts) and LLM rubrics, with weighted partial credit.
- **Agents** — Gemini CLI and Claude Code harnesses, running in Docker or locally. You can create a custom agent or use with another agent by extending the `BaseAgent` class.

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Basic eval (Gemini, Docker, 5 trials, skills auto-included)
GEMINI_API_KEY=key npm run eval -- superlint

# Claude agent
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=key npm run eval -- superlint --agent=claude

# Options
npm run eval -- superlint --provider=local --trials=3
npm run eval -- superlint --no-skills
npm run eval -- superlint --parallel=3

# Validate graders with the reference solution
npm run eval -- superlint --validate --provider=local

# Run a suite of tasks
npm run eval -- _ --suite=workflow

# Analytics (Normalized Gain)
npm run analyze -- --logDir=./results

# Preview results
npm run preview                    # CLI report (default)
npm run preview -- browser         # Web UI → http://localhost:3847
```

```

### task.toml

```toml
version = "1.0"

[metadata]
author_name = "Your Name"
difficulty = "hard"
category = "workflow-compliance"
tags = ["example"]

[agent]
timeout_sec = 300.0

[environment]
build_timeout_sec = 180.0
cpus = 2
memory_mb = 2048
storage_mb = 500

[[graders]]
type = "deterministic"
command = "bash tests/test.sh"
weight = 0.7

[[graders]]
type = "llm_rubric"
rubric = "prompts/quality.md"
weight = 0.3
```

## Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pass Rate** | Average reward (0.0–1.0) across trials |
| **pass@k** | Probability of ≥1 success in k trials |
| **pass^k** | Probability of all k trials succeeding |
| **Normalized Gain** | Relative improvement from skills: `(with - without) / (1 - without)` |
| **Duration / Commands** | Per-trial timing and command count |

## Best Practices for Running Evals

Based on recommendations from [Demystifying Evals for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

**How many trials?** Agent behavior is non-deterministic. A single run tells you almost nothing.

| Goal | Recommended Trials | Metric to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Quick smoke test | 3–5 | pass@k |
| Reliable pass rate estimate | 10–25 | Pass Rate (mean reward) |
| High-confidence regression detection | 25–50 | pass^k |

- **pass@k** (≥1 success in k trials) tells you if the agent *can* solve the task. Use this for capability evals and new tasks.
- **pass^k** (all k trials succeed) tells you if the agent *reliably* solves the task. Use this for regression suites where consistency matters.
- A task with pass@5 = 100% but pass^5 = 30% indicates the agent *can* do it but is flaky — worth investigating the transcript.

**Grader design:**
- Grade *outcomes*, not *steps*. Check that the file was fixed, not that the agent ran a specific command.
- Use deterministic graders for objective criteria and LLM rubrics for qualitative assessment (workflow compliance, efficiency).
- Always validate graders with `--validate` before running real evals. If the reference solution doesn't pass, your graders are broken.

**Task quality:**
- Every task should have a reference solution (`solution/solve.sh`) that proves solvability.
- Test both positive and negative cases — a grader that always returns 1.0 is useless.
- Start with 3–5 well-designed tasks rather than 50 noisy ones.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are loaded from `.env` files and forwarded to the agent's execution environment (Docker container or local process). Loading order (later overrides earlier):

1. **Root `.env`** — project-level secrets (API keys)
2. **Task `.env`** (`tasks/<name>/.env`) — task-specific variables
3. **Process env** — `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the shell override everything

```bash
# Root .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key

# tasks/my_task/.env
CUSTOM_API_URL=https://internal.example.com
DEBUG=true
```

All values are automatically **redacted** from persisted session logs.

## Ollama Configuration

For optimal performance with the local LLM grader, set these environment variables **before** starting `ollama serve`:

| Variable | Recommended | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION` | `1` | Enable flash attention for faster inference |
| `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE` | `q8_0` | Use quantized KV cache (50% memory reduction vs FP16) |
| `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` | `1` | Single request at a time (grading is sequential) |
| `OLLAMA_NUM_THREAD` | CPU core count | Explicit thread count (workaround for ARM64 core detection bug) |

Example (Linux/macOS):
```bash
OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0 OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 OLLAMA_NUM_THREAD=$(nproc) ollama serve
```

Example (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION="1"; $env:OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE="q8_0"; $env:OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL="1"; $env:OLLAMA_NUM_THREAD="12"; ollama serve
```

The LLM grader will warn at runtime if these variables are not detected.

## Security

API keys are injected via environment variables and **automatically redacted** from all persisted logs.
