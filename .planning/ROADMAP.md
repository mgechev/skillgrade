### v2.0: opencode + Ollama Agent Backends

- [ ] Phase 4: OllamaToolAgent + Ollama Model Setup
- [ ] Phase 5: OpenCodeAgent
- [ ] Phase 6: CI Integration
- [ ] Phase 7: End-to-End Validation + Performance Comparison

#### Phase 4: OllamaToolAgent + Ollama Model Setup

**Goal:** Prove a local Ollama model can complete agent tasks via direct API tool calling.

**Requirements:** AGENT-01, OLCFG-01, OLCFG-02, OLCFG-03, PIPE-01, PIPE-03

**Delivers:**
- Ollama agent model pulled and configured with working context window (custom Modelfile)
- `OllamaToolAgent` class with tool-calling loop (read_file, write_file, bash, list_directory)
- `--agent=ollama` CLI flag
- Tool-calling smoke test as pre-eval gate
- Sequential model loading (agent unloaded before grader)
- superlint_demo completes locally with OllamaToolAgent

**Key risks:**
- Ollama 4K default context silently breaks tool calling -- custom Modelfile required
- Small models (8B) may emit tool calls as text instead of structured API -- smoke test catches this
- Model must support tool calling natively (qwen3:8b is the candidate)

---

#### Phase 5: OpenCodeAgent

**Goal:** Wrap the opencode CLI as an agent backend, leveraging the Ollama model proven in Phase 4.

**Requirements:** AGENT-02, PIPE-02, PIPE-04

**Delivers:**
- `OpenCodeAgent` class wrapping `opencode run` CLI
- opencode.json config injection (Ollama provider, model, permissions auto-approve)
- `--agent=opencode` CLI flag
- External kill timer on subprocess (opencode hangs on errors)
- superlint_demo completes locally with OpenCodeAgent

**Key risks:**
- opencode `run` hangs indefinitely on errors (issue #8203) -- external timeout required
- Config precedence can silently override model/permissions -- explicit config injection
- x64 binary runs under emulation on ARM64 dev machine -- may be slower

---

#### Phase 6: CI Integration

**Goal:** Both agent backends run in CI with proper setup actions.

**Requirements:** CI-01, CI-02, CI-03, CI-04

**Delivers:**
- setup-ollama action extended: agent model pull, Modelfile variant creation
- setup-opencode composite action: install, config generation, OPENCODE_BIN_PATH
- CI runner platform resolved (ARM64 with fix or x64 fallback)
- `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1` in CI to prevent OOM
- Both agents complete superlint_demo in CI

**Key risks:**
- opencode linux-arm64 SIGABRT (issue #13367) -- may need x64 runner
- 16GB RAM runner must fit agent model + grader model sequentially
- opencode auto-update in CI adds latency -- disable with env var

---

#### Phase 7: End-to-End Validation + Performance Comparison

**Goal:** Validate both agents meet the 15-minute target and compare their performance.

**Requirements:** AGENT-03, AGENT-04, PERF-01, PERF-02

**Delivers:**
- superlint_demo verified end-to-end with both agents (local + CI)
- Per-trial completion within 15 minutes confirmed
- Performance comparison: time, pass/fail, tool calls (manual comparison from existing reports)
- Documented recommendation for which agent backend to use by default

**Key risks:**
- Performance may vary significantly between local (ARM64 emulation) and CI
- Grading accuracy may differ based on agent output format differences
