# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Run skill evaluations entirely offline using local LLMs -- no API keys, no cloud costs, no network dependency.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- GitHub Actions CI as first phase (safety net before behavioral changes)
- Agent CLI backends (opencode, Claude Code) deferred to v2
- Coarse granularity: 3 phases derived from 18 requirements
- No combined test script -- CI runs test:bootstrap and test:analytics as separate parallel jobs
- Composite action excludes checkout -- each job checks out separately
- NODE_OPTIONS max-old-space-size=4096 at workflow env level
- [Phase 01]: No combined test script -- CI runs test:bootstrap and test:analytics as separate parallel jobs
- [Phase 01]: Composite action excludes checkout -- each job checks out separately for clarity
- [Phase 01]: NODE_OPTIONS max-old-space-size=4096 at workflow env level for all jobs
