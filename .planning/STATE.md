# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Run skill evaluations entirely offline using local LLMs -- no API keys, no cloud costs, no network dependency.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 gap closure complete. All 5 plans done. Ready for phase verification.

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (Local LLM Grader) -- ALL PLANS COMPLETE (pending verification)
Plan: 5 of 5 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: All gap closure plans executed, ready for phase verification
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Phase 2 Plan 05 verified (Node.js environment for LocalProvider)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 32 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. CI Foundation | 1/1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2. Local LLM Grader | 5/5 | 29 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (5 min), 02-02 (5 min), 02-03 (2 min), 02-04 (2 min), 02-05 (15 min)
- Trend: stable (02-05 was human verification with long bootstrap test)

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 02 P02 | 5min | 1 tasks | 0 files |
| Phase 02 P03 | 2min | 1 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 02 P04 | 2min | 1 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 02 P05 | 15min | 1 tasks | 0 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- GitHub Actions CI as first phase (safety net before behavioral changes)
- Agent CLI backends (opencode, Claude Code) deferred to v2
- Coarse granularity: 3 phases derived from 18 requirements
- No combined test script -- CI runs test:bootstrap and test:analytics as separate parallel jobs
- Composite action excludes checkout -- each job checks out separately
- NODE_OPTIONS max-old-space-size=4096 at workflow env level
- [Phase 01]: No combined test script -- CI runs test:bootstrap and test:analytics as separate parallel jobs
- [Phase 01]: Composite action excludes checkout -- each job checks out separately for clarity
- [Phase 01]: NODE_OPTIONS max-old-space-size=4096 at workflow env level for all jobs
- [Phase 02]: Ollama is a provider within existing llm_rubric type, not a new grader type
- [Phase 02]: Default model qwen3:4b chosen for small footprint on 16GB RAM runners
- [Phase 02]: JSON schema format object in Ollama API for structured output
- [Phase 02]: 5s timeout for health check, 5min timeout for generation
- [Phase 02]: Retry up to 3 times on parse failure but no retry on connection error
- [Phase 02]: No code changes needed -- all tests pass as-is, confirming clean Ollama integration
- [Phase 02]: Use !model.includes(':') guard for prefix match branch instead of exact match redundancy
- [Phase 02]: Use path.delimiter for cross-platform PATH separator in runCommand
- [Phase 02]: PATH assignment after ...env spread to ensure workspace bin/ always takes precedence

### Pending Todos

3 pending:
- Add task bin directory to PATH in LocalProvider (tooling)
- Fix Node.js not found in LocalProvider workspace (tooling)
- Ollama LLM grader times out in bootstrap test on ARM64 (testing)

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
