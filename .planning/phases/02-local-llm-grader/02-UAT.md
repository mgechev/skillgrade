## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Ollama Grader Mock Tests Pass
expected: Run `npm run test:ollama-grader`. All 19 tests pass covering: Ollama health check, model availability, retry logic for malformed JSON, fallback chain (Ollama -> Gemini -> Anthropic), JSON schema structured output, and model name prefix matching (e.g. "qwen3" matches "qwen3:latest").
result: pass

### 2. SKILL.md Agent Frontmatter
expected: Open `tasks/superlint_demo/skills/superlint/SKILL.md`. File begins with YAML frontmatter containing `name: superlint` and a `description` field. This enables agent CLI auto-discovery of the skill.
result: pass

### 3. Evaluation Without Ollama (Graceful Degradation)
expected: With Ollama NOT running, run `npm run eval:superlint`. Deterministic grader scores 1.0. LLM grader gracefully degrades to score 0 (no crash, no unhandled error). Overall pass_rate is approximately 0.70 (from weighted average: 1.0 * 0.7 + 0.0 * 0.3). Console output shows a warning about Ollama being unavailable, not an unhandled exception.
result: pass

### 4. Local Provider PATH Augmentation
expected: Run `npx ts-node tests/local-provider.test.ts`. All 3 tests pass confirming: workspace bin/ is prepended to PATH in spawned bash processes, task CLI tools are executable by name (not requiring absolute paths), and custom environment variables are preserved alongside the PATH augmentation.
result: issue
reported: "FAIL: workspace bin/ is first on PATH - FAIL: Expected first PATH entry to end with /bin, got /usr/local/sbin. FAIL: task-provided CLI is executable by name - EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rmdir temp dir. FAIL: custom env vars are preserved - FAIL: Expected 'hello', got ''"
severity: major

### 5. Bootstrap End-to-End Test
expected: Run `npm run test:bootstrap` with Ollama running. LLM grader produces an actual 0.0-1.0 score from Ollama inference (not 0.00 from timeout). Deterministic grader scores 1.0. This verifies Success Criterion 1: Ollama produces real LLM grading scores with no cloud API keys.
result: issue
reported: "llm_rubric scored 0.00 despite Ollama running. Ollama is up (curl confirms) but qwen3:4b inference does not complete within the timeout on ARM64 CPU. Deterministic grader works (1.00) but the primary Phase 2 deliverable -- local LLM grading producing a real score -- is not met."
severity: blocker

  root_cause: "PATH fix in 9188bc9 uses path.delimiter (;) on Windows but MSYS2/Git Bash translates semicolon-separated PATH at shell startup, potentially reordering entries. BASH_ENV from parent process may source a startup file that resets PATH and clobbers custom env vars. EBUSY on temp dir cleanup is Windows file-locking race (Defender/Search Indexer holding scan lock after process exit)."

  root_cause: "Three compounding issues: (1) Hardcoded AbortSignal.timeout(300000) at src/graders/index.ts:238 is 5 min but should be ~60s for grader response (5 min was the trial budget, not grader budget). (2) qwen3:4b is a thinking model that generates chain-of-thought tokens before the answer, consuming most of num_predict:2048 budget on thinking. (3) No explicit num_ctx set -- Ollama defaults to 2048 (NOT model's native 32,768), which may silently truncate grading prompt (~825 tokens) + response budget (2048) = ~2900 tokens needed. At 2048 default, prompt is truncated from beginning with no warning. (4) Silent failure -- evalRunner.ts prints score but not details, hiding the timeout reason."
